# Calculadora
my first GUI program, a simple calculator, hours of research.

Nothing special, just a single class calculator wich probably have many errors that i didn't test yet.
Im a newly spawned programmer so this code may be dirty, i don't know.

To run this program you must download(or copy the source code of) the .java file and compile it via command prompt(In your working directory):<br>
```diff
javac Calculadora.java
```
or
```diff
javac -verbose Calculadora.java
```
if you want more information during the compiling process<br>
Bear in mind this was one of mi first GUI programs and the logic behind it it's also from a beginner programmer
